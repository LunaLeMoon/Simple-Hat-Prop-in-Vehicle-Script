# Simple-Hat-Prop-in-Vehicle-Script

Hello! I am Luna, I am a texture artist, videographer and amateur script developer. This is the first script I publish. With that said, say hello to the Simple Hat-Prop-In-Vehicle Script! 

This script is designed to detect whether a player is wearing a hat/helmet (has a hat prop equipped), and ensures that said hat/helmet stays equipped when the player enters a vehicle. The purpose of this script is for aesthetic consistency, therefore, better gameplay.

The original intention for this script is for to ensure consistency when filming videos on FiveM, but, I would like to extend this for anyone who would like to use it for their server, recordings, etc.

Please refrain from making edits to the script if you're not sure what you're doing, otherwise it will not work for you. However, since it is free to use/edit, you may customize it for your needs, although please ensure you've credited me should you publish your version of my script. Cheers!
